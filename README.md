## About me

Hi There! I am a fourth-year student in Applied Computer Science at Dalhousie University in Canada.

After 7 years in project management, I'm now diving into computer science.

I've got hands-on experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, PHP, Python, and C#. 

With a year of software development under my belt, I'm excited about coding, problem-solving, and the constant learning in tech. 

This shift lets me blend my pm background with the challenges of computer science. It's not just a career change; it's a mix of my past and a fresh start in the dynamic tech world.
