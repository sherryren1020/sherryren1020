## About me

After 7 years in project management, especially in the ERP industry, I'm now diving into computer science.
I've got hands-on experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, PHP, Python, and C#. 
With a year of software development under my belt, I'm excited about coding, problem-solving, and the constant learning in tech. 
This shift lets me blend my pm background with the challenges of computer science. It's not just a career change; it's a mix of my past and a fresh start in the dynamic tech world.
